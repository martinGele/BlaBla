    <string name="AboutText" formatted="false">As a young chef in Brussels, Alain Coumont could not find the right bread to serve in his restaurant. Passionate about quality, he returned to his roots and decided to make it himself. He opened a small bakery where he could knead organic flour, salt and water into what have become his signature rustic loaves. That was in 1990, and those loaves are now the focal point of Wetzel\'s simple, wholesome cuisine in more than 200 locations on five continents.</string>

    <!-- <string name="FAQDiscription">At Zoës we think life is meant to be celebrated with great food, friends and fun\!\ We believe that part of getting the most out of life is setting realistic goals to be healthy, spend time with loved ones, lifelong learning, and giving back to the community. One of the BEST parts of setting goals is treating yourself when you’ve reached them.\nThat’s what this app is all about. We hope that you’ll it helpful in getting more out of life, treats and all!\n\nTo participate in the LIFE Challenge:\nEach week you can complete up to 7 challenges customized for you by Zoës. Simply tap on the Life Goals tab and you’ll be prompted to choose up to 3 goal areas. A week’s worth of challenges will be determined by your selected goal areas and will refresh every Sunday with a new set of challenges. Do as many as you can, but don’t worry if you can’t complete them all – we know your life is busy!\n\nAfter you’ve performed one of your weekly challenges, mark it as complete by tapping on the check box next to it. You’ll see your cup of Limeade fill a bit and once the cup is full you’re eligible for a Goodie from Zoës!\nYou can change your Goal Areas at any time by scrolling to the bottom of your weekly challenge list.</string> -->
    <string name="FAQQ1">How does this work?</string>
    <string name="FAQA1">Earn <i>Love</i> by dining at WETZEL\'S and sending us a picture of your receipt through the app. To send your receipt tap the Snap button on the Home screen (or just tap the Snap tab), choose your location, and click the Use button. $1 = 10 points and every time you submit a receipt, you will be eligible to earn points! In order to receive points you must submit an itemized receipt, not a credit card receipt, kitchen slip, or other ordering receipt. Points can be awarded for the purchase of a gift card but not for payments made using gift cards. We are not able to award points for the purchase of alcohol. The correct receipt will be the receipt you receive from the cashier with subtotal and tax information listed as well as the items ordered for your meal.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ2">How do I know how many points I have?</string>
    <string name="FAQA2">Tap the Love tab on the navigation bar. There you can track how many points you have and how far away you are from being able to redeem the <i>Love</i>. Green-colored rewards are ready to be redeemed. Light green-colored rewards are ones you are still working towards earning – when you have enough points to redeem one of these rewards, it will turn green.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ3">How do I redeem the <i>Love</i>?</string>
    <string name="FAQA3">In the Love tab, tap on any Green-colored reward that you want to redeem and it will instantly turn into a digital reward that you can present to the cashier at check-out. Click on “Redeem the <i>Love</i>” when you are in line to order, and then “Confirm” when you are IN FRONT OF THE CASHIER. You will have a couple minutes to show the cashier your unique code.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ4">How do I use my digital voucher?</string>
    <string name="FAQA4">Just tap the blue Redeem reward button that appears after you’ve selected the reward you’d like to redeem.  Show your phone to the cashier.  Once you have redeemed your reward you cannot redeem it again until you have accumulated enough points to do so. You’ll need to be connected to your mobile network in order for the voucher to successfully be redeemed.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ5">I\'m having trouble uploading my receipt from the app. What do I do?</string>
    <string name="FAQA5">Email the image receipt to us along with your account email address (the one you use for log in) to wetzels@rlvt.net.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ6">Can I make some suggestions?</string>
    <string name="FAQA6">Sure! We\'d be happy to hear from you at wetzels@rlvt.net.</string>
